   * - The class must be implemented in Kotlin (unless using a custom generator, see [generator]).
   * - The class may not be an abstract class, an inner class, or a local class.
   * - All superclasses must be implemented in Kotlin.
   * - All properties must be public, protected, or internal.
   * - All properties must be either non-transient or have a default value.

   * An optional custom generator tag used to indicate which generator should be used. If empty,
   * Moshi's annotation processor will generate an adapter for the annotated type. If not empty,
   * Moshi's processor will skip it and defer to a custom generator. This can be used to allow other
   * custom code generation tools to run and still allow Moshi to read their generated JsonAdapter
   * outputs.
   *
   * Requirements for generated adapter class signatures:
   * - The generated adapter must subclass [JsonAdapter] and be parameterized by this
   * type.
   * - [Types.generatedJsonAdapterName] should be used for the fully qualified class name
   * in order for Moshi to correctly resolve and load the generated JsonAdapter.
   * - The first parameter must be a [Moshi] instance.
   * - If generic, a second [Array<Type>][Type] parameter should be declared to accept type
   * arguments.
   *
   * Example for a class "CustomType":
   *
   * ```
   * class CustomTypeJsonAdapter(moshi: Moshi, types: Array<Type>) : JsonAdapter<CustomType>() {
   * // ...
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * To help ensure your own generator meets requirements above, you can use Moshiâ€™s built-in
   * generator to create the API signature to get started, then make your own generator match that
   * expected signature.
